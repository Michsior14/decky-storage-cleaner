# Storage Cleaner (Decky Loader Plugin)

A [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) plugin for tidying up your Steam Deck's storage (and getting rid of that pesky 'Other' storage eating it all up)! Quickly visualize, select and clear shader cache and compatibility data.

## Features

- Get disk usage stats for your Steam Deck's shader cache and compatibility data
- Selectively clear the shader cache and compatibility data you don't want
- Clear all the shader cache or compatibility data all at once

Storage Cleaner is completely free-to-use. It is built and maintained in my spare time. With your help I can remain caffeinated and awake - squashing bugs, adding features and creating more useful plugins.
